# JSON Project

## Author

## Project Description
This Project creates a Base type for a set of subtypes allowing a user to store, print, and modify JSON objects and variables. This automatically prints in JSON format.

## What went well
I feel that the primitive types were easier to implement then the Object and Array types.
The print functions for all types were also very quick and were reminiscent of previous courses.

## What went bad
I feel that the formatting fixes for Objects and Arrays had to be resubmitted more times than they should have been.
I feel that I should have understood the implementations of the clone functions earlier in the project before trying to write them.
